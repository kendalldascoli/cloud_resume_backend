# Cloud Resume Challenge - Backend Repository

This backend repository is essential to the Cloud Resume Challenge, supporting key aspects of source code management, version control, and CI/CD automation.

## Purpose and Benefits

1. **Source Code Management**
   - This repository stores the code for the backend API, which powers the visitor counter on the website and handles any additional database interactions.
   - It enables organized code storage, ensuring all backend logic is centralized and accessible for development and maintenance.

2. **Version Control**
   - By using Git, we can track all changes made to the backend code. This allows us to review the history of modifications, revert to previous versions if necessary, and maintain a clean, structured development process.
   - Version control is especially valuable for managing and recording changes over time, supporting team collaboration and individual development.

3. **CI/CD Automation**
   - The repository integrates with CI/CD tools (such as GitHub Actions) to automate testing and deployment processes.
   - When changes are pushed to the repository, workflows are triggered to automatically test and deploy updates to AWS Lambda.
   - This automation ensures smooth, consistent deployments, enhancing reliability and reducing the need for manual updates.

## How it Works

- **Visitor Counter**: The backend API increments and retrieves visitor count data, displaying it dynamically on the website.
- **CI/CD Workflows**: Configured workflows run tests and deploy code directly to AWS Lambda upon each push, maintaining up-to-date functionality on the website.

This repository serves as the foundation for reliable backend functionality in the Cloud Resume Challenge, showcasing best practices in cloud infrastructure and DevOps.
